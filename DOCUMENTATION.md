# Naming Conventions

When they are needed, comments should be used to explain **why** a particular piece of code does something. Any comments that are used must be kept up-to-date or deleted.
Block comments should generally be avoided, as code should be as self-documenting as possible, with only the need for intermittent, few-line explanations.

>Exception: This does not apply to those comments used to generate documentation.
